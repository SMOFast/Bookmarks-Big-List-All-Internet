## File Encryption

⚠️ Always use Full Disk Encryption on all your drives instead of encrypting folders.

  * [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html) – VeraCrypt is free open-source disk encryption software for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. In case an attacker forces you to reveal the password, VeraCrypt provides plausible deniability. In contrast to file encryption, data encryption performed by VeraCrypt is real-time (on-the-fly), automatic, transparent, needs very little memory, and does not involve temporary unencrypted files.
  * [GNU Privacy Guard: Email Encryption](https://gnupg.org/index.html) – GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your email data and communications.
  * [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/) – File archiver with a high compression ratio and built-in encryption functionality.
  * [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) – Cryptomator encrypts your data quickly and easily. Afterwards you upload them protected to a cloud service.
  * [Hat](https://hat.sh/) – Client-side browser encryption to encrypt your data quickly and easily. Afterwards you upload them protected to a cloud service.
  * [Picocrypt](https://github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt) **-** Uses the secure XChaCha20 cipher and the Argon2id key derivation function to provide a high level of security, even from three-letter agencies like the NSA. Simply drop your files, enter a password, and hit Start to encrypt.
