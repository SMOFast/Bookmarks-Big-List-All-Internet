## Scanning and Pentesting

  * [ACSTIS](https://github.com/tijme/angularjs-csti-scanner) – ACSTIS helps you to scan certain web applications for AngularJS Client-Side Template Injection (sometimes referred to as CSTI, sandbox escape or sandbox bypass). It supports scanning a single request but also crawling the entire web application for the AngularJS CSTI vulnerability.
  * [BruteShark](https://github.com/odedshimon/BruteShark) – A Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) that performs deep processing and inspection of network traffic (mainly PCAP files, but it also capable of directly live capturing from a network interface).
  * [DroneSploit](https://github.com/dhondta/dronesploit) – A pen-testing console framework dedicated to drones.
  * [Infection Monkey](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey) – A semi automatic pen testing tool for mapping/pen-testing networks. Simulates a human attacker.
  * [Is website Vulnerable](https://github.com/lirantal/is-website-vulnerable) – Finds publicly known security vulnerabilities in a website's front-end JavaScript libraries.
  * [OWASP Testing Checklist](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_Checklist) – List of some controls to test during a web vulnerability assessment. Markdown version may be found [here](https://github.com/amocrenco/owasp-testing-checklist-v4-markdown/blob/master/README.md).
  * [PTF](https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf) – The Penetration Testers Framework (PTF) is a way for modular support for up-to-date tools.
  * [Pentest Tool LITE, OS tool to analyse page for most common issues](https://pentest-tool-lite.com/) – You can use it as command line utility installed as global package through npm or yarn, or you can use web app.
  * [KeyCDN Tools](https://tools.keycdn.com/http2-test) – Verify if a URL is delivered through the HTTP/2 network protocol.
  * [PhpSploit](https://github.com/nil0x42/phpsploit) – Full-featured C2 framework which silently persists on web server via evil PHP oneliner. Built for stealth persistence, with many privilege-escalation & post-exploitation features.
  * [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng) – Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework.
  * [Spyse](https://spyse.com/) – Spyse is an OSINT search engine that provides fresh data about the entire web. All the data is stored in its own DB for instant access and interconnected with each other for flexible search.
  * [padding-oracle-attacker](https://github.com/KishanBagaria/padding-oracle-attacker) – Padding-oracle-attacker is a CLI tool and library to execute padding oracle attacks (which decrypts data encrypted in CBC mode) easily, with support for concurrent network requests and an elegant UI.
  * [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/) – SQLMap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
  * [w3af](http://w3af.org/) – W3AF is a Web Application Attack and Audit Framework. The project’s goal is to create a framework to help you secure your web applications by finding and exploiting all web application vulnerabilities.
  * [ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) – The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
