## Tor News

**This section is not finished.**

  * Tor is not perfect same like any other protocol it has weaknesses but depending on how you count far less than most other known protocols. This argument makes it worth alone to suggest using the tor network.
  * JavaScript among some other old and outdated web-standard are among the highest threat to the tor network, this is not really a tor network issue because tor simply need to fallback to older standards to not entirely breaking the web as we know it.
  * Tor does not encrypted inbound traffic, for this you would need I2P. You can use I2P together with Tor but it is more configuration trouble.
  * Content is encrypted between client and nodes but not from exit relay to server. The anonymity relies on servers, the more servers the more anonymous the user is because he can easily hide in the mass. However, if someone compromise hundreds of Tor Relays the entire privacy aspect will be lowered or even compromised.
  * HTTPS redirects can be blocked so Tor isn't a fail-safe alternative.
  * Using a browser add-on that rewrites the URL request before it's sends a GET request is paramount to security. If relying on the initial request to redirect after the fact the resulting method could be overwritten by an exploited endpoint.
  * Combining Invisible Internet Project alias I2P and Freenet for file-sharing could help solve some, but not all problems.
  * The biggest problem with Tor is that it is not really usable in the real world due to how it works, most websites simply ban Tor traffic, or you get spammed with CAPTCHAs. Some ISPs directly flag you if you use the tor network which means you are classified as possible threat which makes you more unique among – normal – users.

**Major problems while using Tor**

  * Constantly reCaptcha requests, which you need to solve. Almost every captcha system is at some point privacy invasive by design.
  * Lots of providers throttle your internet connection once they detect, unusual, traffic. This can make you more likely a target because you stick out like a needle from the mass.
  * Security pages, like banking often entirely block connections coming from Tor users which makes it impossible to use Tor on eg. your banking page. Trying to workaround this often results in more fingerprinting and restrictions.

**Tools**

  * Nipe – Nipe is a script to make Tor Network your default gateway.
