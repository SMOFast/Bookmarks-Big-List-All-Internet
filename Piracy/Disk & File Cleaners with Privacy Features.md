## Disk & File Cleaners with Privacy Features

  * [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org) – Shredding files and wiping unallocated disk space to minimize data remanence.
  * [ExifCleaner](https://exifcleaner.com/) – Removes metadata for the most popular image and video formats. It also supports PDF files and comes with batch-processing to process multiple files at once. Drag and Drop interface, easy to use.
  * [Mat2](https://matweb.info/) – mat2 is a metadata removal tool, supporting a wide range of commonly used file formats, written in python3: at its core, it's a library, used by an eponymous command-line interface, as well as several file manager extensions.
  * [Metapho](https://zininworks.com/metapho/) – iOS photo metadata manager app.
  * [ScrambledExif](https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif)  **-** This Android app will remove all this data before sharing. Just share a picture like you'd normally do and choose _Scrambled Exif_. A moment later, the share 'dialog' will reappear. Just share with the app you intended to share with in the first place. Et voilà!
  * [ImagePipe](https://codeberg.org/Starfish/Imagepipe) – This Android app reduces image size by changing the resolution and quality of the image. It also removes exif data before sending the image. The modified image is saved in a separate folder in jpeg, png or webp format. The original image remains unchanged.
