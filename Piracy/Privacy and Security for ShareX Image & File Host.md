## Privacy and Security for ShareX Image & File Host

⚠️ The ShareX Image Host Community is incompetent and cannot secure a server or their sources. Some of which these image has gotten data breached or source got leaked by one of their old admins or a random user. They also like to be in drama and ddos. The average developer in the sharex image host community is between ages 13-16. They also can’t afford actual VDS/VPS, Which that means is they use free credits VPS that offers that like Vultr, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud, Azure, And Linode. Probably some of them have ip logging in their source as some of them do. I will provide the ones with the best list of security and that will respect your privacy.
