## Reliability

⚠️ Imgur.com had a [databreach](https://blog.imgur.com/2017/11/24/notice-of-data-breach/) on November 24, 2017.

  * [Imgur](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-sharex-to-take-screenshots-and-upload-them-to-a-private-imgur-album/) – Imgur is an American online image sharing and image hosting service with a focus on social gossip that was founded by Alan Schaaf in 2009. The service has hosted viral images and memes, particularly those posted on Reddit. **I will recommend to use Imgur for reliability due to some people having money issues or Just not being up for years. (Also they require phone number, So use the phone number alias list.)**

⚠️ E.Z.Host had a databreach and it is ran by a 16 year african-american kid. But it is still up and he hired some developers to add some cool features..
